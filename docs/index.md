# AzureClusterlessHPC.jl - Simplified parallel computing on Azure with Julia

## Overview

**AzureClusterlessHPC.jl** is a package for simplified batch computing in the cloud. AzureClusterlessHPC.jl borrows the syntax of [Julia's Distributed Programming](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/) package to easily execute parallel Julia workloads in the cloud using batch computing services such as [Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/).
